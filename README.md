A DOCUMENT PROCESSING SYSTEM-
The document processing system integrates a suite of NLP functionalities to streamline text analysis and content extraction, summarized as follows:
Topic Modeling, Classification, and Sentiment Analysis: This module categorizes documents by topics, classifies them into predefined classes, and assesses their sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), making it valuable for document sorting, customer feedback analysis, and sentiment tracking.
Title, Abstract Generation, and Summarization: Using summarization techniques, the system can generate document titles and abstracts, as well as reduce lengthy texts to concise summaries, enabling quick overviews and easier navigation of complex content.
Keyphrase Extraction and Knowledge Graph Building: It identifies essential keywords or phrases and builds knowledge graphs by extracting entities and their relationships, providing structured insights and connections between concepts in the text.
Document Similarity, Paraphrasing, and Comparison: This functionality compares documents or sections within them, identifies duplicate or similar content, and offers paraphrased alternatives, supporting content variation and version comparison.
Document-Based Q&A: The system includes a simple question-answering feature, allowing users to retrieve specific information from documents through natural language queries, which aids in efficient information access.
